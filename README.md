Welcome! 

For you easily edit system apps, which are worked on Android Studio or Eclipse, Android System Apps Packages require internal API included JAVA Libraries which are compiled with Android Platform. So to get it, YOU MUST COMPILE ANDROID PLATFORM. However, thanks to This repository, you can use already compiled resources to manage android system apps on Android Studio or Eclipse. (Eclipse are not recommanded)
